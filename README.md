Welcome to my application. There is a backend repo as well as a front end (sorry about that!). The application was made using Express.js, cors, Request, and Multer. The front end was made using React.js, Axios, and Crypto-JS.

**Exclaimer**
The application isn't fully functioning right now. This was my first experience using the Request and Crypto-JS (I have never calculated hashes before) as well as my first experience uploading files. I would love to ask some questions if you have time!

All of the GET routes work, but I am having an issue where the POST route successfully posts to the MetaDefender API, but it is sending an empty request body. I did some research, and tried to use Multer to fix it, but I have also never used Multer (lol).

As for front end issues, 

After cloning the repos, you can just do an "npm -i" to install all of the packages.

To test, you can simply upload a file, and the associated information should show up below it.
